# GoGame

Kick-off: June 18th

## Day 1
>1. Implement function ToLowerCase() that has a string parameter str, and returns the same string in lowercase.

## Day 2
>1. Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.
Return the minimum number of students not standing in the right positions.  (This is the number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.)

## Day 3
>1. Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.
For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is the domain name.
Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s.
If you add periods ('.') between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.  For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.  (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)
If you add a plus ('+') in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.  (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)
It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.
Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list.  How many different addresses actually receive mails? 

## Day 4
>1. Given an array of integers A sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.
> 2. The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
    ```
    F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
    F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
    ```
    Given N, calculate F(N).

## Day 5
>1. Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

## Day6
>1. Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

## Day 7
>1. Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Day 8
>1. Given a string S of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.
We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.
Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It is guaranteed the answer is unique.

## Day 9
>1. Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.
>2. Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between L and R (inclusive).
The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

## Day 10
>1. Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in the BST that the node's value equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.
>2. Given a binary tree, each node has value 0 or 1.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is 13.
For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.
Return the sum of these numbers.
>3. Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

## Day 11
>1. Invert a binary tree.
>2. A binary tree is univalued if every node in the tree has the same value.
Return true if and only if the given tree is univalued.

## Day 12
>1. Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
>2. International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows: "a" maps to ".-", "b" maps to "-...", "c" maps to "-.-.", and so on. For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:
    ```
[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
    ```
    Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter. For example,     "cba" can be written as "-.-..--...", (which is the concatenation "-.-." + "-..." + ".-"). We'll call such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.
Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

## Day 13
>1. In a array A of size 2N, there are N+1 unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated N times.
Return the element repeated N times.

## Day 14
>1. Given a matrix A, return the transpose of A.
The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over it's main diagonal, switching the row and column indices of the matrix.
>2. Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor of B.
(A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.)

## Day 15
>1. You need to find the largest value in each row of a binary tree.
>2. Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
    Note:
    The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

## Day 16
>1. Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.
Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
>2. Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

## Day 17
>1. On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost cost[i] assigned (0 indexed).
Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You need to find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

>2. Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

## Day 18
>1. You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Day 19
>1. Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).
Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.
Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

## Day 20
>1. The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

## Day 21
>1. Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Find the letter that was added in t.
>2. Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
>3. Given a positive integer, check whether it has alternating bits: namely, if two adjacent bits will always have different values.
